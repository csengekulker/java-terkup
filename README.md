# Java MVC Template

This is an MVC template to easily create and get started with Java GUI Desktop applications.

> **This is NOT a final version, there may be further improvements and additions.**

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Recommended usage of the folder structure:

- `views`: files configuring and displaying windows and components
- `models`: files creating custom or default models to build components
- `controllers`: files controlling behaviors of different windows and components

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
